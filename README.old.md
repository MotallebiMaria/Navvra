# Navvra
Navvra is a real-time AI-powered Chrome extension that reconstructs cluttered web layouts into a clean, adaptive floating panel. It detects key actions and information on any page, then reorganizes them into a simplified interface so users who struggle with cognitive load or visual clutter can navigate faster and more intuitively.
